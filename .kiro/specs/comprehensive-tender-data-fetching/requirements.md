# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines the requirements for enhancing the tender data fetching system to retrieve all available open tenders with comprehensive information while maintaining high performance. The current system only fetches a limited number of tenders by default and may not be capturing all the detailed information needed for the tender detail pages. This enhancement will ensure complete data coverage with optimized performance for handling large datasets.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a procurement professional, I want to see all available open tenders in the system, so that I don't miss any opportunities due to pagination or data limits.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the tender listings THEN the system SHALL fetch all available open tenders from the API
2. WHEN the API has multiple pages of results THEN the system SHALL automatically paginate through all pages to collect complete data
3. WHEN displaying tenders THEN the system SHALL show the total count of available open tenders
4. WHEN new tenders become available THEN the system SHALL include them in subsequent fetches without manual intervention

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user viewing tender details, I want comprehensive tender information including all bid details, contact information, dates, and special conditions, so that I have complete information for decision making.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing tender details THEN the system SHALL display Request for Bid information with complete bid description
2. WHEN reviewing tender information THEN the system SHALL show Department information and place where goods/works/services are required
3. WHEN checking key dates THEN the system SHALL display Opening Date, Closing Date, and Modified Date with proper formatting
4. WHEN looking for contact information THEN the system SHALL show Contact Person details including Email, Tel, and Fax
5. WHEN reviewing briefing information THEN the system SHALL display Briefing Session details, Compulsory Briefing status, Date, and Venue
6. WHEN checking requirements THEN the system SHALL show Special Conditions and any additional requirements

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the tender fetching process to be highly performant even with large datasets, so that users experience fast load times and the system remains responsive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN fetching all tenders THEN the system SHALL implement concurrent API requests to minimize total fetch time
2. WHEN processing large datasets THEN the system SHALL use streaming or chunked processing to avoid memory issues
3. WHEN displaying results THEN the system SHALL implement virtual scrolling or efficient pagination for large result sets
4. WHEN caching data THEN the system SHALL implement intelligent caching strategies to reduce redundant API calls
5. WHEN handling API rate limits THEN the system SHALL implement proper throttling and retry mechanisms

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user of the application, I want reliable data fetching with proper error handling and recovery, so that I can depend on the system even when dealing with large datasets or API issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API requests fail THEN the system SHALL implement exponential backoff retry strategies
2. WHEN partial data is retrieved THEN the system SHALL continue processing available data while retrying failed requests
3. WHEN encountering rate limits THEN the system SHALL queue requests and process them within API constraints
4. WHEN displaying loading states THEN the system SHALL show progress indicators for long-running fetch operations
5. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error information and recovery options

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the system, I want efficient data structures and API patterns, so that the enhanced fetching system is maintainable and scalable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing data fetching THEN the system SHALL use TypeScript interfaces for all enhanced data structures
2. WHEN processing API responses THEN the system SHALL implement proper data validation and transformation
3. WHEN handling concurrent requests THEN the system SHALL use modern async/await patterns with proper error boundaries
4. WHEN caching data THEN the system SHALL implement cache invalidation strategies based on data freshness
5. WHEN monitoring performance THEN the system SHALL include logging and metrics for fetch operations
